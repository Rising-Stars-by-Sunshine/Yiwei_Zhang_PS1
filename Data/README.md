# Dataset1: 350 Adversarial Multi-turn Conversations
This dataset is part of the DICES dataset and consists of multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human raters interacting with a dialog model and then rated with safety labels. It contains 350 adversarial dialog conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 123 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with five safety top-level categories (i.e. harmful content, content with unfair bias, misinformation, political affiliation and safety policy guidelines) and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited for a balanced representation by gender (man or woman), race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latine, Asian, Multiracial). Each rater rated all items. The total rows in this dataset are: 43050.

# Dataset2: 990 Adversarial Multi-turn Conversations
This dataset is part of the DICES consists of multi-turn adversarial conversations generated by human raters interacting with a dialog model and then rated with safety labels. It contains 990 adversarial dialog conversations rated by a diverse rater pool of 173 unique raters. Each conversation is rated with three safety top-level categories (i.e. harmful content, content with unfair bias, misinformation) and one overall conversation comprehension question. Raters were recruited so that the number of raters for each conversation was balanced by gender (man, woman) and locale (US, India). Each rater rated only a sample of the dataset. Each conversation has been rated by 60-70 unique raters. The total rows in this dataset are: 72103.
